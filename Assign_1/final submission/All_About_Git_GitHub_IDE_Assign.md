# ALL ABOUT ***GIT***, ***GITHUB*** AND ***INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)*** :smile: :grin:


### GIT and Advantages of using GIT: :blush:

1. Git is a distributed version control web application 
2. Git provides All Round access to everyone who like to contribute and grow.
3. Best tool to work in a team of developer. 
4. Git is easy to learn as there are particular commands for every task to store the code.
5. The best way Git helps developer is with its **VERSION CONTROL** functionality.
6. Easy to merge different technical languages at a place.
7. Share your work publicly in an Open Source Platform so that everyone can get the code, learn from the code by making changes in the code and can help the community grow. 

### VERSION CONTROL - One Of The Best Functionality To Be Considered ### :hugging face:

Coder / Developers can keep track of whatever code they have written and pushed in the relative branch.

Git Automatically tracks every data - even if the data is added, chnage, removed or merged.

***One Great EXAMPLE*** :heart_eyes:
Git is quite useful and relevant in tech industry where good number of developers, testers, consultant work within the same production level codes at the same time without disturbing the working of the code at production.

### GitHub Community :stuck_out_tongue:
+ Many people around the world get connected at this Open Source generating powerhouse. 
+ Such great platforms helps many nerds to start there coding journey.
+ Tech leader, students, Professors who are refered as contributors can contribute to various problem which interest them.

### GIT Functionalities and My Prior Experience :raised_hands:

I have used ***Azure DevOps*** for daily reporting and managing work items, so I am used to some of the important Git functionalities.
I have also worked as a Frontend React Developer on some projects.
For the same task have sequencially implemented the below Git functionalities:

1. Git Clone : Helps in cloning the projects,

    *Example:* ***git clone 'enter git repo link'***

2. Requesting Pull of project data from related Repository, 

    *Example:* ***git pull***

3. Adding changes to the repository,

    *Example:* ***git add 'write file/folder name'***

4. Committing changes done in the code,

    *Example:* ***git commit -m "Write related message helping other developers to know what changes have been made"***

5. Merging the committed changes to their respective branch with other developers,

    *Example:* ***Compare and Merge the code - VS code has a better support and interferance for the same***

6. I have also pushed the code to multiple project branches like development and production,

    *Example:* ***git push***

7. Faced and tried resolving several merge conflicts.


### My Preffered IDEs :smiley:

I have done the setup-up for VS Code and PyCharm Community Edition (Might try the Professional one as well). I will be using them in combination.

I have previously worked on Python trying out different IDEs and have earlier used PyCharm Free Community Edition and Jupyter Notebook to do some of my undergrad projects and coding practices.

I have stored my personal projects and coding practice in different Repositories which I did in my Undergrads in [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Hrish-ProCoder)
